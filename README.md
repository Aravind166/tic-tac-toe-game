Concepts Agent: entity that perceives its environment and acts upon that environment. State: a configuration of the agent and its environment. Actions: choices that can be made in a state. Transition model: a description of what state results from performing any applicable action in any state. Path cost: numerical cost associated with a given path. Evaluation function: function that estimates the expected utility of the game from a given state. Algorithms DFS (depth first search): search algorithm that always expands the deepest node in the frontier. BFS (breath first search): search algorithm that always expands the shallowest node in the frontier. Greedy best-first search: search algorithm that expands the node that is closest to the goal, as estimated by an heuristic function h(n). A* search: search algorithm that expands node with lowest value of the "cost to reach node" plus the "estimated goal cost". Minimax: adversarial search algorithm.
